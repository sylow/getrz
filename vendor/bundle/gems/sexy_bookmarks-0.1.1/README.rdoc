The show_sexy_bookmarks method receives 3 parameters, this is what its signature looks like:

  show_sexy_bookmarks(content, socials = nil, per_row = 8)

* The content parameter is a hash that contains, all the article text options such as title, permalink and post summary
* The socials parameter is an array that contains a collection of the social networks we wish to show
* Finally the per_row parameter is the number of social network icons that fit in your design, by default SexyBookmarks will use 100% of the space available, knowing how many links can fit is useful to properly show/hide the links upon hover

Only the first parameter is mandatory.

==== Choosing your social networks
By default SexyBookmarks will show all the links available, however you can choose what links to show simply by passing the show_sexy_bookmarks an array of networks like this:

  <%= show_sexy_bookmarks( options, [ :facebook, :linkedin, :googlebuzz, :myspace ] )

The uses_sexy_bookmarks method on your controller set an instance variable to true which is the compared to load the CSS in your application layout, this method also takes a parameter:

  uses_sexy_bookmarks :only => [ :show ]
  
This will ensure that the SexyBookmark CSS is only loaded when you visit the actions in the method's parameter.
